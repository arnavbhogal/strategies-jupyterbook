Greedy Strategy (Pyramiding Gap Strategy)  

The Greedy Strategy, also known as the Pyramiding Gap Strategy, is designed for traders who aim to maximize profits during strong market trends. Unlike conservative systems that scale out or secure partial profits early, this method does the opposite — it scales in aggressively as the market confirms strength. By continuously adding to winning positions, it aims to capture outsized returns during explosive moves.  

Why It’s Called “Greedy”  

This strategy earns its name because it thrives on expansion — both in price movement and in position size. It uses a technique called pyramiding, where additional trades are placed in the direction of profit. In some implementations, it can hold up to 100 simultaneous trades, compounding the gains as long as the trend remains intact. The idea is simple: let winners run, and amplify them while they’re still strong.  

Trade Logic  

The entry logic is based on price gaps and momentum confirmation. When the market opens with a gap-up above the previous day’s high, it signals strong buying pressure — a cue to enter a long position. As the price continues to close strong throughout the session, additional positions are added. This pyramiding process continues as long as momentum persists.  

For protection, the strategy includes an intraday trade limit to control overexposure and maintain discipline. It also uses a small fixed profit target per position, locking in steady gains while still leaving room for additional trades to participate in the trend.  

Pros  

- Allows for enormous profit potential during sustained trends  
- Uses stop orders for structured and rule-based entries  
- Built-in trade limits reduce excessive overtrading  

Cons  

- Requires high margin due to multiple open trades  
- Extremely risky during market reversals when trends abruptly end  
- Exposed to drawdowns if pyramided positions unwind quickly  

Possible Improvements  

Several refinements can make this strategy more resilient and balanced. One improvement is to use ATR-based targets to adapt profit-taking levels dynamically according to market volatility. Adding trend confirmation filters such as moving averages or momentum indicators can help avoid false breakouts. Additionally, implementing scaled position sizing — where trade sizes decrease with each new pyramid layer — can reduce risk while maintaining upside exposure.  

Final Thoughts  

The Greedy Strategy is not for the faint of heart. It rewards patience, discipline, and precise execution during powerful market trends but can also lead to rapid losses if not carefully managed. For experienced traders who understand volatility and risk control, it can be a valuable tool for amplifying profits. However, success lies in combining aggression with prudence — being greedy only when the market offers clear and strong opportunities.
